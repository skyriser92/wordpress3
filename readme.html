	<li>1. Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>2. Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser. It will take you through
		the process to set up a wp-config.php file with your database connection details.
				a. If for some reason this does not work, don’t worry. It does not work on
					all web hosts. Open up wp-config-sample.php with a text editor like
					WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.
				b. Save the file as wp-config.php and upload it.
				c. Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser.</li>
	<li>3. Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed
			for your blog. If there is an error, double check your wp-config.php file, and try
			again.</li>
	<li>4. If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you. If you did not provide a username,
		it will be admin.</li>
	<li>5. The installer should then send you to the login page. Sign in with the username and password you
		chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on “Profile”
		to change the password.
