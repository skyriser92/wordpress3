<h1>How To Collaborate In GitHub</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>A GitHub account</li>
	<li>A local installation of Git</li>
	<li>PHPStorm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collaboration Instructions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Firstly, you need to make a repository on GitHub.  Simply log into the website and on the home page press the
		green "New" button.</li>
	<li>Once you have a repository, you need to add your teammates as collaborators.  To do this, click on the Settings
		tab on your repository page, then on that page click the collaborators sidebar and enter the usernames of your
		teammates to send them an invite</li>
	<li>Once you've added everyone to the repository as a collaborator, it's time to clone the repository into PHPStorm.
		To do this, launch PHPStorm and access the VCS option from the top menu.  Scroll down to "Checkout from Version Control,"
		and select Git.  If this is your first time accessing Git from within PHPStorm, you might be asked to log into your Git
		account.  Do so if prompted, using your Github credentials.  A dialogue box will pop up, featuring a textbox asking for
		a url, and below that you will be asked to confirm a filepath to where you want to save it.  Set up the filepath first or
		simply leave it default, and in the top textbox, copy and paste the URL of your repository, and select Clone.  This will
		download the selected repository to your local machine.</li>
	<li>
		After cloning the repository, you'll need to create a new local branch for you to work on. All team members must do this,
		and must all name their branches differently.  To do this, go to the bottom right corner of the PHPStorm window and look for
		"Git: Master."  Click on this, and a dialogue box will pop up.  Select the option labelled "New Branch," and give your branch
		a name.  Your branch is basically a copy of the current project  that you'll be modifying independantly of the repository and
		the rest of the team.
	</li>
	<li>
		After making the desired changes to your branch of the project, it's time to get ready to submit them back to the repository.
		The first step in this process is to Commit your changes.  Think of this like saving your work, but also more formally creating
		a new version of the project.  To do this, go to the top right corner of PHPStorm and look for the green checkmark.  If you don't
		see it, go to the View button in the top toolbar, select Tool Windows, then Version Control.  In any case, after selecting the
		Commit button, a window will pop up.  Several different things will be on this window, but the two things we're concerned with
		are the top window that shows the project hierarchy and the textbox below that.  Before we finalize the commit, make sure all files
		that your changed are selected in the hierarchy window, or just select the whole project for good measure.  Afterwards, click on
		the textbox below that, and type a descriptive, useful message about what you did in this commit.  A good format to follow is,
		"Task: fed all the monkeys."  After that, press the blue commit button at the bottom of this window to finalize your commit and
		prepare it to be uploaded to GitHub.
