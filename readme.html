<h1>How To Collaborate In GitHub</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>A GitHub account</li>
	<li>A local installation of Git</li>
	<li>PHPStorm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collaboration Instructions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Firstly, you need to make a repository on GitHub.  Simply log into the website and on the home page press the
		green "New" button.</li>
	<li>Once you have a repository, you need to add your teammates as collaborators.  To do this, click on the Settings
		tab on your repository page, then on that page click the collaborators sidebar and enter the usernames of your
		teammates to send them an invite</li>
	<li>Once you've added everyone to the repository as a collaborator, it's time to clone the repository into PHPStorm.
		To do this, launch PHPStorm and access the VCS option from the top menu.  Scroll down to "Checkout from Version Control,"
		and select Git.  If this is your first time accessing Git from within PHPStorm, you might be asked to log into your Git
		account.  Do so if prompted, using your Github credentials.  A dialogue box will pop up, featuring a textbox asking for
		a url, and below that you will be asked to confirm a filepath to where you want to save it.  Set up the filepath first or
		simply leave it default, and in the top textbox, copy and paste the URL of your repository, and select Clone.  This will
		download the selected repository to your local machine.</li>
	<li>
		After cloning the repository, you'll need to create a new local branch for you to work on. All team members must do this,
		and must all name their branches differently.  To do this, go to the bottom right corner of the PHPStorm window and look for
		"Git: Master."  Click on this, and a dialogue box will pop up.  Select the option labelled "New Branch," and give your branch
		a name.  Your branch is basically a copy of the current project  that you'll be modifying independantly of the repository and
		the rest of the team.
	</li>
	<li>
		After making the desired changes to your branch of the project, it's time to get ready to submit them back to the repository.
		The first step in this process is to Commit your changes.  Think of this like saving your work, but also more formally creating
		a new version of the project.  To do this, go to the top right corner of PHPStorm and look for the green checkmark.  If you don't
		see it, go to the View button in the top toolbar, select Tool Windows, then Version Control.  In any case, after selecting the
		Commit button, a window will pop up.  Several different things will be on this window, but the two things we're concerned with
		are the top window that shows the project hierarchy and the textbox below that.  Before we finalize the commit, make sure all files
		that your changed are selected in the hierarchy window, or just select the whole project for good measure.  Afterwards, click on
		the textbox below that, and type a descriptive, useful message about what you did in this commit.  A good format to follow is,
		"Task: fed all the monkeys."  After that, press the blue commit button at the bottom of this window to finalize your commit and
		prepare it to be uploaded to GitHub.
	</li>
	<li>
		After committing your changes, you still need to upload them to GitHub.  To accomplish this, open the Git menu
		under VCS again, but this time scroll down and press the green "Push" icon.  A new window will open prompting you
		to select what to upload to Github.  Normally there is only one option here.  After confirming your selection,
		press the blue button at the bottom of this window and it will be uploaded to GitHub.  Depending on the size of
		the project this may take up to a few minutes, so consider this to be some built-in free time.
	</li>
	<li>
		While pushing your changes to Github updates the repository, your local copy will not be updated to reflect any
		changes your team mates have made since you initially cloned the repository.  To correct this, open the Git menu
		and select the blue "Pull" button.  This will automatically update your local copy of the project with any new
		changes made by other contributors.
	</li>
	<li>
		After pulling the most recent version of your project, you can merge your partner's branches into one of your
		local branches for ease of access.  To do this, go to the bottom right corner of PHPStorm, click on the tab that
		previously said "Git: Master," and examine the menu that opens up.  If your are not in your local master branch,
		click on it in this menu and select the "Checkout" option.  This will switch your active branch.  Once you are
		in the branch you would like to merge into, click on the other branches in the menu and select "merge into current."
		Merging branches allows you to access all files from all branches from within a single branch.
	</li>
	<li>
		At some point during your project you may find yourself needing to update the main version of the project.  To do
		this, after merging into and committing one local branch, go to the repository on GitHub, and click on the Code
		tab.  From here you can see all pushed commits made to the repository.  Find the commit you would like to have
		serve as the new master branch for the repository, and click on the "New Pull Request" button.  THis will take you
		to a page where you can fill out some info about your branch and why it should be the new master.  From there,
		the project leader will decide which pull request to make the new master branch.  At this stage they will have to
		handle merge conflicts, most likely caused by two files with the same names but different contents. These can be
		resolved by either replacing one of the conflicting files or by integrating their contents to suit the project's
		scope and goals.
